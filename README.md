# Moving Out - Halloween
(Name WIP)

This is a fork of the moving game, but fully redesigned with new Halloween-themed abilities, maps, and a new lobby.
This game was made for and will be publicly submitted to the Novetus Halloween 2022 Place Contest by October 8. 
Playtesting and feedback for the game will begin from then until October 22nd. Hopefully, we win!
